            <h3>How do you select a Quality system that's just right for you?</h3>

            <p>
                This <b>FREE</b> service will match your specific needs with the right system/software. 
                The service takes advantage of a unique algorithm that will match your specific 
                needs with a matrix of over 75 Production/Quality systems on the market. 
                This will save you time, do the legwork for you and narrow it down to the chosen few. 
                The input needed for this algorithm is a completed spreadsheet provided for you to 
                rate & weight many needs & functions using a numerical scale and to input some complementary
                data.  Once complete, the algorithm will report the results – a short list of 
                matching systems/software vendor(s).

            <h3>
                Discrete Part / Automotive & Steel
            </h3>
            
            <p>
                In the first example, the client was a discrete part manufacturer in the 
                automotive & steel industries. Their primary need was for a Production-based 
                management system, with real-time SPC integration. Other needs included 
                Document Control, Tool & Gauge Management, and Preventative Maintenance. 
                They did not rate Supplier Management and Compliance Management which may 
                mean they had systems in place for those functions. Vendor “CN1” scored as 
                the best match for this client with several others close behind. Keep in mind, 
                other discrete part manufacturers in the automotive & steel industry could get 
                quite different results depending upon their “specific” needs.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Process/SCADA-based / Chemicals / FDA Regulations
            </h3>
        
            <p>
                In the next example, the client’s functionality was process oriented as 
                opposed to discrete part with an emphasis in chemicals and liquids with FDA 
                regulations.  Their primary need was for a Process/SCADA-based management 
                system, with real-time SPC integration. Other needs included Supplier Management, 
                CRM and Compliance management. They did not rate Document Control, 
                Tool & Gauge Management, or Preventative Maintenance as primary needs. 
                Vendors “CJ1” and “F1” scored well for this client. See the chart below.

            <h3>
                Ad-hoc / Desktop Analytical
            </h3>

            <p>
                In the final example, this client’s functionality was focused more on ad-hoc desktop 
                analytical needs rather than online functions on the production floor. 
                These include Document Control, CRM & Complaint Tracking, CAPA Management, 
                Compliance Management, Auditing Management, and Environmental Health & Safety (EH&S). 
                Several Vendors scored well for this client. See the chart below.
