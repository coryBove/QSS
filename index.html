                What system/software is the perfect fit for your application? 
                If you are ready to purchase a system, our algorithm will match 
                your specific needs with a matrix of over 75 Quality systems on 
                the market including Production-based, SCADA-based, and desktop 
                analytical software programs. We’ll save you time, do the legwork 
                for you and narrow it down to the chosen few. In general, think 
                of this like a HR function narrowing down 100 job applicants to a 
                chosen few for you to interview.

            <h2>Some Background</h2>
            <p>
                Automated Production/Quality systems have weathered many technical & cultural 
                storms since the introduction of the personal computer (PC) and the subsequent 
                proliferation of many application software programs. These applications covered 
                the gamut including but not limited to Supplier Management & Control, 
                Production Management, Process Control, Statistical Process Control, 
                Preventative Maintenance, Tool & Gage Management, Document Control, 
                Customer Relationship Management (CRM) & Complaint Tracking, Compliance Management, 
                Audit Planning & Management, and CAPA Management. The end results yielded hundreds 
                of vendors offering these applications. Over the years, many vendors & programs fell 
                by the wayside while others were bought out by other software firms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Still today, there are over 75 systems/software firms that offer the entire gamut 
                or some subset of the applications above. Moreover, many of these firms are “hidden” 
                in the market, (they do little mass advertising) yet offer excellent products. 
                Furthermore, some firms offer a unique architecture/platform tailored toward 
                specific needs, applications, and market segments.
            </p>
            <h2>Who are we and where are we coming from?</h2>
            <p>
                The key principal has spent almost 40 years in the “Quality” discipline as both a 
                vendor of systems and an end-user. On the vendor side, he worked for four 
                (4) Quality Systems vendors in sales, support, and training & implementation roles. 
                As an end-user, he worked for various companies as a Quality Director, Quality Manager, 
                and Project Leader roles. Therefore, we bring a unique perspective to this field. 
                He has also consulted in this area and published several articles in various trade 
                journals over the years. This particular matrix & algorithm was actually created in 
                the early 90’s after a presentation at the Quality Expo in Chicago on the types of systems 
                on the market. Since then, vendors have been added & subtracted over the years through 
                ongoing thorough research. More recently, we’ve used this matrix & algorithm under contract 
                with some clients. There are other websites/companies that offer a similar free service. 
                However, their focus is spread-out over-all disciplines and functional areas. 
                Our focus is strictly in the “Quality” niche.
            </p>
            <h2>Some Common Observations and Myths</h2>
            <p>
                <b>The more features/functions, the better the product.</b> Many sales folks will tell you 
                their system will do everything from “A to Z”. That’s nice except you may only need 
                “A thru E, K, M, & S”. The rest of the features are fine, but will never be used. 
                Some software firms have excellent products that specialize in a unique function 
                or market niche.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Just because systems/software firms don’t advertise in the major trade journals, 
                doesn’t mean they don’t exist.</b> Many firms don’t see the need or the ROI for this promotional
                tactic. Our matrix consists of 75 systems/software firms – some of which are 
                out-of-business! Yes, we list and monitor these firms because in many instances the 
                source code & intellectual property magically appears with another firm. 
                This traceability is important especially when evaluating how the buying firm integrates 
                the different technologies together.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>The software is user-friendly!</b> All vendors say that. Well, we hope so! 
                They wouldn’t be in business if the software was difficult to use. Since nobody can 
                define “User-friendly”, we’ll just toss this aside and maintain neutrality.  
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>The software firm was the “first” to market or the “only” firm to offer...</b>
                After many years of analysis, it’s difficult to put a date/time stamp on any 
                “first” and we’ve seen multiple firms claim they are the “only” company to offer a 
                specific function or calculation. We’ll just take this with a grain of salt.
