                How does this work? How do I get the ball rolling? It’s really quite simple and 
                best of all – it’s FREE! We’ll email you a spreadsheet listing a number of select
                functions/features. You simply rate & weight each one using a numerical scale. 
                Then, provide some additional information on your company and needs in the spreadsheet 
                as well. Save the spreadsheet and email it back to us. We will then run the algorithm 
                and do some additional research for you. Finally, we’ll reply with the results – 
                some select systems/software vendor(s) for you to contact. We do not consider the price 
                of the software. There are companies out there that offer free pricing guides for 
                various software products. Those pricing guides are obsolete the day they are created. 
                Also, pricing models & tactics change more often than the weather. In general, think 
                of this like a HR function narrowing down 100 job applicants to a chosen few for 
                you to interview.
